Getting Exceptions / Errors in web application is quiet common
behavior in internet world.

When Exception Occurred in web application it doesn’t make any

 ‘@ExceptionHandler only handles exception getting raised from the
controller where it is defined.

It will not handle exceptions getting raised from other controllers.
@ControllerAdvice annotation solves this problem.

@InitBinder, and @ModelAttribute methods that apply to all
@RequestMapping methods.
